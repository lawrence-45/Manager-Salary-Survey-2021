# Manager-Salary-Survey-2021-Analysis
## Overview
Data cleaning and analysis of real-life dataset using SQL. This project showcases my SQL skills.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes columns like timestamp, age range, work industry, job title, job_title_additional_context, annual_salary, additional_monetary_compensation, currency, Other_currency, income_additional_context, work_country, works_in_us_state, work_city, professional_work_experience, professional_work_experience_field, level_of_education, gender, race. 
Individuals from different countries and regions filled these columns, making the dataset messy and less useable.

## Key Questions To Be Answered
* Which industry pays the most?
* How does salary increase with experience?
* Salary variations for the same role with different experience levels?

* Correlation of race and education level with salary?

## SQL Functions Used
* Common Table Expressions(CTE)
* Group By
* Order By
* Having
* Subqueries
* Alias
* Temp Table
* Aggregate Function
* Case Statement
* Windows Function etc.

## Data Cleaning 
This was done fully using SQL, duplicating the initial dataset, and working my way through the dataset.

## Data Analysis 
The questions were answered using SQL queries, from the analysis of the already-cleaned dataset, we were able to deduce the following
* Media/communication pays the highest: $163,600.22 on average.
* Average salary vs. experience: 1 year or less ($133,086.01) surprisingly tops, followed by 21-30 years ($110,524.87).
* Salary for the same role varies significantly by location, reflecting local economic conditions and cost of living.
* Salary by gender: Females earn the most on average, followed by males and non-binary individuals.
* Bachelor's degree holders earn the highest on average across most races.
